# Todo App Example

This is a simple todo app example.
It uses the [nested-TEA pattern](https://sporto.github.io/elm-patterns/architecture/nested-tea.html) to demonstrate
how to build a complex app with multiple pages. It doesn't mean the pattern is encouraged to be used in a small app like this.

## Setup

run launch.sh in the project root:

```bash
cd src/example
bash ./launch.sh
``` 

This scripit will build the project with js backend, and launch the server with node.
