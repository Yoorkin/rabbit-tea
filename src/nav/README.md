# Navigation

This package provides a collection of functions to navigate, scroll the viewport, 
and manage the URL history in a web application. Each function returns a `Cmd[Msg]` 
type, representing an action that has yet to be executed.

For more details on how commands work, see the documentation in the 
`rabbit-tea/cmd` package.
